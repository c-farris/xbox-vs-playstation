	 <h2> Microsoft Background </h2>
            
	 <p> <span>Microsoft</span> was originally based in New Mexico and now it is based in Washington. <br>
		Before the launch of Xbox, Microsoft had released operating systems and computers. <br>
		They where the worlds biggest personal computer software company at the time. <br>
	 </p>
	 
	 <ul>
		<li> <span>1975:</span> Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates & Paul Allen </li>
		<li> <span>1981:</span> Microsoft license their MS-DOS Operating System to IBM </li>
		<li> <span>1981:</span> First Personal Computer released </li>
		<li> <span>1985:</span> Windows Operating System released</li>
		<li> <span>1995:</span> Windows95 released </li>
		<li> <span>1995:</span> Internet Explorer released </li>
		<li> <span>2001:</span> Original Xbox launched
	 </ul>
	
	 <p> You may be wondering why Microsoft launched a gaming console when their computers and operating 
		systems where doing phenomenal at the time. <br>
		Well, Microsoft was focused on computers until a Sony advert claimed: <br>
		<span>"The PlayStation 2 would be so powerful, it would be like a personal computer in the living 
		room"</span>.
		Microsoft did not take this lightly and saw that as a challenge, because Microsoft was known
		for personal computers.
		Microsoft thought:  <span>"If anyone is going to make a console as powerful as a personal computer it is
		going to be us"</span>. In return they made and launched the original Xbox to beat Sony at there own game.

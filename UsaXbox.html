	<h2> Xbox Evolution </h2>
	 
	<h4> Original Xbox </h4>
	<p> Throughout the years, Microsoft has released four generations of the Xbox including multiple models and 
		designs for all but one generation. The original Xbox launched in 2001, and the Xbox got its name because
		it was based on Microsoft's <span>'DirectX'</span> Technology. The only console that has one version is 
		the original Xbox. However, the original controller, "Duke", did get a slim version called "Controller S" 
		due to the Duke controller being oddly big.
	</p>
	
	<h4> Xbox 360 & Kinect</h4>
	<p>	After much success Microsoft launched the <span>Xbox 360</span> in late 2005. The Xbox 360 brought many 
		upgrades from the original Xbox, but the main issue it had was the "Red Ring of Death". 
		This was a result of a hardware failure, and the issue got its name because many thought there was no way 
		of fixing it and your Xbox was pretty much done for. 
		<br><br>
		Following the Red Ring of Death issue Microsoft then released the Xbox 360 S (2010) and the 
		Xbox 360 E (mid 2013). <span>The Xbox 360 S</span> brought a slimmer console style, built in Wi-Fi for 
		wireless connectivity, and redesigned hardware to fix the previous issues. 
		<br>
		The final model was the <span>Xbox 360 E</span> which ran quieter and cooler than older models, 
		and this new console design resembled the upcoming Xbox One design.
		<br><br>
		Along side the Xbox 360 S Microsoft also released the <span>Kinect</span> accessory. The Kinect was an 
		accessory that allowed the user to play interactive games without a controller. This system used cameras 
		and sensors to track what the user was doing. For example, the user would be able to play a dance game 
		without the need of a controller and the Kinect would use the camera to track the motions of the 
		user.
	</p>
	
	<h4> Xbox One</h4>
	<p> In late 2013 the <span>Xbox One</span> launched. Microsoft wanted the console to work for all 
		entertainment needs including being able to plug in your cable box to watch TV. However, the all-in-one 
		concept didn't last long due to some bad functionalilty. Instead the Xbox One was a gaming-first console, 
		and it was less expensive than the original concept price. Also, a few months later a new version of the 
		<span>Kinect</span> released.
		<br><br>
		A few years later in 2016 the <span>Xbox One S</span> released and it was slimmer than the first Xbox One.
		This new console had a 4K Blu-ray player, supported 4K/HDR video streaming services, and HDR support for
		games. These where huge upgrades because back then 4K disc players and devices weren't as common as they
		are now.<br> Also, later in 2019 Microsoft released a <span>digital verision</span> of the Xbox One S, and 
		it was more affordable. The digital version doesn't have a disc drive, so all games must be bought 
		digitally and downloaded.
		<br><br>
		To complete the model line up the <span>Xbox One X</span> released in late 2017. The Xbox One X brought 
		4K/HDR gaming without the need for a new generation of consoles. Surprisingly even with the upgrades the 
		console still maintained its slim and compact design. The Xbox One consoles also introduced backwords 
		compatability. This means you can play Original Xbox, and Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One consoles if 
		they are compatable games. 
		<br> <br>
		Backword Compatible Games List:

	</p>
	
	<h4> Xbox Series X|S </h4>
	<p>  In 2020, Microsoft outdone themselves and released both the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S at the same
		time. The two consoles have the same concept but are uniquely different, and these consoles are now 
		considered next gen consoles. Both consoles offer quick resume, up to 120FPS gaming, and much more. 
		<br> <br>
		Xbox X|S Features: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/compare" target="_blank"> 
		https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/compare </a>
		<br> <br>
		First, the Xbox <span>Series X</span> is the biggest and most powerful of the two consoles. 
		It has 1TB of internal storage, 12 Teraflops of processing power, and TRUE 4K gaming resolution.
		The Series X is the way to go if you like the bigger look, and you can spend a chunk of money because 
		it is almost double the price of the Series S.
		<br> <br>
		Next, the Xbox <span>Series S</span> is all digital and much smaller than the Series X.
		It only has 512GB of internal storage, 4 Teraflops of processing power, and 1440P resolution.
		It doesn't have a disc drive, so again everything is digital. If you want to try out a next gen console,
		don't mind digital, and want a cheaper alternative then the Series S is for you.
		<br>
		Microsoft has brought amazing upgrades to these next gen consoles. With two unique options most people are
		sure to find one they enjoy.

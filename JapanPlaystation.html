	<h2> PlayStation Evolution </h2>
	 
	<h4> PlayStation </h4>
	<p> Sony's first console was the <span>PlayStation</span> that launched in 1994. The PlayStation was one of the 
		first few 3D consoles, and was considered the first CD based to gain popularity. The console was a 
		smash hit and paved the way for many other consoles to come, but the backstory can be shocking. In 1991, 
		Nintendo wanted to make a CD-based add on for the Super NES console, and Nintendo wanted to work with
		Sony to make the console. However, Nintendo ditched Sony and decided to work with Philips instead. Sony did
		not take this lightly and chose not to scrap the CD-based console they had been working on. Therefore, Sony
		released the PlayStation on their own. Since the PlayStation was CD-based it was capable of more storage
		and game content. The CD element also allowed music tracks and videos. Then A few years later in 2000 
		Sony released the <span>PS One</span>. This console was a smaller version of the previous PlayStation. 
		Also, a few years ago in 2019 Sony released the <span>PlayStation Classic</span> which is a mini version 
		of the first PlayStation.
	</p>
	
	<h4> PS2 </h4>
	<p> In 2000 Sony also launched the <span>PS2</span>. With the PS2 Sony added in DVD support to bring the whole
		multimedia experience. Aside from DVD support the console also brought tons of new games, and allowed
		backword compatabilty with PS One games. Sony decided to keep the previous DualShock controller design, but
		added a few upgrades like pressure-sensitive face buttons. The PS2 is also believed to be the most popular 
		console ever made selling almost 160 million units to date.<br>
		Since the PS2 did very well Sony decided to release the <span>PS2 Slim</span>. The PS2 Slim was a smaller 
		and thinner version of the PS2, and the console had a top-loading disc drive instead of a disc tray.
	</p>
	
	<h4> PSP </h4>
	<p> Later on in 2005 Sony launched the <span>PSP</span> (PlayStation Portable). The PSP broke the boundary
		between consoles and handheld gaming devices. It allowed the user to play thier favorite games on the go.
		It allowed the user to watch movies, view photos, listen to music, play games, and connect to the internet.
		Sony was able to take the abilities of a PlayStation console and put it into a handheld device. 
		The PSP did so well Sony went on to release more versions including the <span>PSP-2000</span> ("Slim and 
		Light Edition"), <span>PSP-3000</span> ("Bright and Light Edition"), <span>PSP-N1000</span> ("PSP Go"), 
		and the <span>PSP-E1000</span>. Sony also released another handheld device called the <span>PS Vita</span>
		in 2012.
	</p>
	
	<h4> PS3 </h4>
	<p> Sony released the <span>PS3</span> in 2006 and with it came good and bad. On a good note the PS3 had a 
		blu-ray disc drive and was the first console to have one. It also brought the Dual Shock 3 controller which
		was the first wireless DualShock controller. On the downside the price of the PS3 was very expensive. Sony 
		wanted the PS3 to have backword capatability with PS2 games, but that is what contributed to the size and
		high price of the PS3. Later on in 2009 the <span>PS3 Slim</span> released and it was lighter and smaller
		version of the PS3. It also ran cooler, quieter, and consumed less power. The PS3 Slim introduced a new
		logo as well. Then for the first time Sony made a second design to a model by releasing the <span>PS3 Super 
		Slim</span> in 2012. As if the the PS3 couldn't get any smaller Sony made this new model 3 pounds lighter 
		than the slim version. Sony made this accomplishment by removing the slot-loading disc tray and replacing 
		it with a sliding lid accessed from the top of the console.
	</p>
	
	<h4> PS4 </h4>
	<p>	 A year later in 2013 Sony released the popular <span>PS4</span> along with the DualShock 4 controller.
		Some upgrades the DualShock controller got was a trackpad, light strip on the back, and a share button allowing
		users to easily share screenshots and videos. The PS4 also offered the same processor architecture that gaming
		PCs use, and games ran extremely well on it. The only downside to the PS4 was it didn't allow backward 
		compatibility with older games. Sony then went on to release the PS4 Slim and the PS4 Pro in 2016.
		The <span>PS4 Slim</span> was, once again, a smaller and lighter variant. It also added Wi-Fi,
		Bluetooth, and USB support upgrades. The final model in the line is the <span>PS4 Pro</span>. It brought
		faster speeds, better graphics, and 4K gaming support. 
	</p>
	
	<h4> PS5 </h4>
	<p>  In 2020 Sony launched the <span>PS5</span> and all PlayStation lovers are trying to get their hands on it 
	till this day. The PS5 has upgrades to the CPU, better graphics than before, and more RAM. The PS5 is backword
	compatible to most PS4 games only. It provides 825GB of storage for both the PS5 and digital version. The PS5 
	has native 4K, and up to 120FPS gameplay. This release also brought the new DualSense controller which has 
	new shoulder triggers, improved haptic feedback, and a built in microphone. Along side the PS5 there is also 
	a <span>PS5 Digital</span> version. The digital version doesn't have a disc drive resulting a lower price, 
	but everything must be bought digitally and downloaded.
